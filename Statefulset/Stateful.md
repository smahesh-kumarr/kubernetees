# 📘 Kubernetes StatefulSet - Complete Guide

## 🔹 What is a StatefulSet?

A **StatefulSet** is a Kubernetes controller used to manage **stateful applications** that require:
- Stable identity
- Persistent storage
- Ordered deployment and scaling

It is the best choice when your app **remembers data or state** and each pod should have its own identity and storage.

## 🚀 Features of StatefulSet

| Feature                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Stable pod names**             | Pods get predictable names like `app-0`, `app-1`, etc. |
| **Stable network identity**      | Each pod gets a stable DNS entry (e.g., `app-0.myservice`) |
| **Persistent storage (PVC)**     | Each pod gets its own PVC that is not deleted when the pod is removed |
| **Ordered startup/shutdown**     | Pods are started and stopped in order: `app-0` → `app-1` → `app-2` |
| **Ordered updates**              | Rolling updates happen one pod at a time in order |
| **VolumeClaimTemplates**         | Automatically generates a separate PVC for each pod |

## 🔄 StatefulSet Workflow

1. You define a StatefulSet with `replicas: 3`
2. Kubernetes creates:
   - Pod: `app-0`, waits till ready
   - Pod: `app-1`, waits till ready
   - Pod: `app-2`
3. Each pod is attached to its own **PVC**:
   - `pvc/data-app-0`
   - `pvc/data-app-1`
   - `pvc/data-app-2`
4. If a pod restarts, it retains:
   - The same **hostname**
   - The same **persistent volume**

## 📦 PVC and PV Behavior with N Pods

If `replicas: N`, the following happens:

| Pod Name     | PVC Created         | PV Behavior         |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `app-0`      | `pvc/data-app-0`     | Unique Persistent Volume |
| `app-1`      | `pvc/data-app-1`     | Unique Persistent Volume |
| `...`        | `...`                | ...                 |
| `app-N-1`    | `pvc/data-app-N-1`   | Unique Persistent Volume |

> 📌 PVCs are **not shared** between pods and **persist** even after pod deletion.

## 💡 Use Cases

- Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Messaging Queues: Kafka, RabbitMQ
- Distributed Systems: Zookeeper, Elasticsearch
- Applications requiring leader election

## 🆚 StatefulSet vs Deployment

| Feature               | **StatefulSet**         | **Deployment**            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Pod names             | Stable (`app-0`)        | Random (`app-abc123`)     |
| Network identity      | Stable                  | Dynamic                   |
| Storage               | Unique PVC per pod      | Shared/no storage         |
| Use case              | Stateful apps           | Stateless apps            |
| Scaling behavior      | Ordered (slow)          | Parallel (fast)           |

---

## ⚠️ Limitations of StatefulSet

- Slower scaling (starts one pod at a time)
- PVCs are not deleted automatically
- Doesn’t perform leader election (handled in app logic)
- Not ideal for stateless or horizontally scalable services

## 📌 Summary

| Type        | Stateful App 🧠      | Stateless App 🧼     |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Keeps data  | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No               |
| Pod identity matters | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No               |
| Use StatefulSet | ✅ Yes           | ❌ No (use Deployment) |
